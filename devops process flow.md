The devops process flow is all about agility, automation and continuous monitoring.
The devops flow involves continuous development, continous integration, testing, monitoring and feedback, delivery and deployment. below are detailed explation of each flow.
Continuous development:
This involves the development of software to be delivered to customer 

Continuous integration:
It involves the regular merge of code by developers into a shared repositories where those updates are regularly tested.

Continuous testing:
Continuous testing is a process that allows developers make sure the code actually works the way it was intended to work. Testing is used to search for bugs in codes and if any, it would be pushed back to developers for continuous imrovement.

Continuous monitoring and feedback:
This process allows IT operations to idenntify issues and notify developers. The majority of monitorinng should be automated to reduce human error. Continuous feedback ensure higher security and feedback.

Conntinuous delivery:
This is a logical step from continuos integration. Code changes are automatically built, tested and deployed for production.

Continuos deployment: 
This is a fully automated version of continuos delivery with no human intervention necessary. For continuos deployment to work well, organizations needs to have a rigorous and reliable automated testing environment, that is why it is important to start with continuos integration and continuous delivery before continuous deployment.
